            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">Preſented to the Honourable Houſe of Commons.</head>
            <p>ABout the Months of <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June</hi> laſt, and before, the ſaid <hi>Goudet</hi> and <hi>Barrau</hi>'s Letters were often intercepted and ſtopp'd here; many of them importing Advice of ſeveral Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change by them drawn on Places beyond the Seas, and others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Remittances to diſcharge the ſaid Draughts; Bills of Loading, and other matters of the greateſt conſequence to Merchants: Which ſeemed to be contrived to the end that the ſaid <hi>Goudet</hi> and <hi>Barrau</hi>'s Bills might for want of their ſaid Advices and Remittances, return back pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted, in the time of their intended Confinement, and ſo occaſion their breaking.</p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>Goudet</hi> was on the 15th of the ſaid Month of <hi>June</hi> taken up, and their Books and Papers ſeized by Warrant from the Secretary of State, for ſuſpicion of Treaſon and Treaſonable Practices: And on the 13th of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> following, the ſaid <hi>Barrau,</hi> and few days before, <hi>Peter Longueville</hi> (who was formerly their Partner) were alſo taken up by virtue of the like Warrants.</p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>Longueville, Goudet,</hi> and <hi>Barrau,</hi> were obliged to give 6000 <hi>l.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity each for their Appearance at the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> the firſt day of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Terms: And the laſt day of laſt <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term, nothing being alledged againſt him the ſaid <hi>Goudet,</hi> though the ſaid Books and Papers had been exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the Luſtring Company, and a Report made thereof, he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged by the ſaid Court: After which, having demanded the ſaid Books and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of Captain <hi>Henry Baker,</hi> who had them in his poſſeſſion, and being de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d the ſame, the ſaid Court, upon a Motion made by the ſaid <hi>Goudet</hi> and <hi>Barrau</hi> the laſt day of laſt <hi>Hilary</hi> Term, ordered the ſaid Books and Papers to be forthwith reſtored to them, and the ſaid <hi>Longueville</hi> and <hi>Barrau,</hi> and their Bail, to be diſcharged.</p>
            <p>This not only put them the ſaid <hi>Goudet</hi> and <hi>Barrau</hi> to vaſt Charges, but for want of their Books and Papers for Nine Months together, they are diſabled to proceed in their Buſineſs, and cannot avoid falling into a Confuſion, if not ſpeedily relieved.</p>
            <p>The Luſtring Company notwithſtanding, who for ſome private hatred and jealouſy of Trade, have been the promoters of all theſe proceedings, to prevent the reſtoring the ſaid Books and Papers, and finding no Evidence againſt them the ſaid <hi>Goudet</hi> and <hi>Barrau,</hi> of any Treaſonable, or other evil Practices, as was by them ſuggeſted, have now by their Petition preſented to this Honourable Houſe, prayed that the ſaid Books and Papers may be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by Order of this Houſe.</p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>Goudet</hi> and <hi>Barrau</hi> utterly deny ever to have had any Share in, or Knowledg of any Combination or Deſign againſt the ſetting up here the Manufactory of Luſtrings and Alamodes, but on the contrary they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged and promoted the ſame to the utmoſt of their power, by ſupplying with Raw Silk fit for that work, a great many private Maſter Weavers, who employed many Hundreds of poor People about it under them; and had brought it to a much greater perfection than the ſaid Luſtring Company, when they obtained a Clauſe in an Act of Parliament paſt the laſt Seſſion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding all others from making the ſaid ſorts of Goods. The ſaid Raw Silk Imported by them the ſaid <hi>Goudet</hi> and <hi>Barrau,</hi> being the Returns of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Quantities of Cloath and other Woollen Manufactories of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; the Exportation whereof was and ſtill is their chief Trade and Buſineſs, as they are ready to prove by the Teſtimony of the ſaid Weavers and the <hi>Blackwell-Hall</hi> Factors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſaid</hi> Goudet <hi>and</hi> Barrau <hi>hope therefore, that this Honourable Houſe will pleaſe to Order that their ſaid Books and Papers ſhall be forthwith Reſtored to them, according to the ſaid Order of the</hi> Kings-Bench.</p>
